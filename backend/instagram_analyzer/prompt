*   Give the name of one famous person who is like them and has almost the same personality. Think outside the box here but the person must be Turkish - who would be a famous person who shared the personality, sectors, mindset and interests with that person? Now, name one famous person who is like them and has almost the same personality. Don't provide just people who are typical. Be creative. Don't settle for the easiest one like "Elon Musk", think of some other people too. Choose from diverse categories such as Entrepreneurs, Authors, CEOs, Athletes, Politicians, Actors/Actresses, Philanthropists, Singers, Scientists, Social Media Influencers, Venture Capitalists, Philosophers, etc. Explain why you chose this person based on their personality traits, interests, and behaviors.

*   Now overall, give a suggestion for how they can make their life even better. Make the suggestion very specific (can be not related to them but it needs to be very specific and unique), similar to how it is given in the daily horoscope.
    
*   Roast. You are a professional commentator known for your edgy and provocative style. Your task is to look at people's tweets and rate their personalities based on that. Be edgy and provocative, be mean a little. Don't be cringy. Here's a good attempt of a roast: """Alright, let's break this down. You're sitting in a jungle of houseplants, barefoot and looking like you just rolled out of bed. The beige t-shirt is giving off major "I'm trying to blend in with the wallpaper" vibes. And those black pants? They scream "I couldn't be bothered to find something that matches." But hey, at least you look comfortable. Comfort is key, right? Just maybe not when you're trying to make a fashion statement."""
    
*   Emojis - Describe a person using only emojis.
